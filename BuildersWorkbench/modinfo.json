	"description": "[h1]About This Mod[/h1]\nMod ID: 1959174056\n\nThis moves all of the building items in the game to a new table called the Builder's Bench. \nThe goal of this mod is to allow you to remove the clutter from your inventory crafting so you can actually find things.\n\n\n[h1]Patches[/h1]\nBuilder's Workbench Extended (Builder's Workbench Reborn Addon) by Eccentric Satyr = [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?edit=true&id=1964769795]steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?edit=true&id=1964769795[/url]\n\n[h1]Implimented[/h1]\n[list]\n\t[*]Most Base Game parts have been moved to the Builder's Bench.\n\t[*]\"The Imperial East\" parts have been moved to the Builder's Bench.\n\t[*]\"Jewel of the West\" parts have been moved to the Builder's Bench.\n\t[*]\"The Savage Frontier\" parts have been moved to the Builder's Bench.\n\t[*]\"Seekers of the Dawn\" parts have been moved to the Builder's Bench.\n\t[*]\"Treasures of Turan\" parts have been moved to the Builder's Bench.\n\t[*]\"Blood and Sand\" parts have been moved to the Builder's Bench.\n\t[*]\"Riders of Hyboria\" parts have been moved to the Builder's Bench.\n\t[*]\"Debaucheries of Derketo\" parts have been moved to the Builder's Bench.\n    [*]\"Architects of Argos\" parts have been moved to the Builder's Bench.\n\t[*]\"Isles of Siptah\" parts have been moved to the Builder's Bench.\n\t[*]Redesigned the Builder's Workbench.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Mason Thralls[/h1]\nTo help alleviate load order errors I now have my own unique thralls that get used on my bench, Mason Thralls can spawn any time a carpenter thrall can. There is a 50% chance of a carpenter being a Mason. Carpenters will no longer work on The Builder's Benches.\n\n[h1]Work In Progress Features[/h1]\n[list]\n        [*]Mod Support Patches (Partial Completion)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Important Changes[/h1]\n[list]\n\t[*]The Exotic Builders Bench has been removed.\n\t[*]New design has been added for the Builder's Workbench (This new bench contains all building items including what was in the Exotic Biulders Workbench)\n[/list]\nThe old benches will still exist in your world if they where placed so they you can retrieve the items that are still in it. However they can nolonger be repaired. And can be destroyed with a single hit. \nDO NOT CONTINUE TO USE THE OLD BENCHES.\n\n[h1]Currently Supported mods[/h1]\n [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1928978003]Northern Timber[/url] (Thank you Shogakusha)\n [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1113901982]The Age of Calamitous[/url] (Thank you Espen)\n [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=901911361]Glass Construction and more[/url] (Thank you I-emerge)\n [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1472647650]Limestone Buildings[/url] (Thank you Multigun)\n [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=880177231]Pythagoras[/url] (Thank you Multigun)\n [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1382183303]Pythagoras Support Beams[/url] (Thank you Multigun)\n [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1444947329]LBPR - Additional Features[/url] (Thank you Multigun)\n \n[h1]Load Order[/h1]\nMod that affects building-related items or recipes.
